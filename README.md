# Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Models

Welcome to this collection of Excel-based discounted cash flow (DCF) models, organized by sector to facilitate investment analysis and valuation. Alongside these, a centralized dashboard excel file offers a consolidated overview of key financial indicators for quick comparison and evaluation.

## Centralized Dashboard

- Risk free rate: US 10Y Treasury Rate
